# üß™ Internship Lab

This repository is a collection of technical tasks I completed during internship interview rounds and pre-joining assessments. It reflects my problem-solving approach, coding style, and ability to work with practical challenges across various domains.

Each task is shared with its original objective and my self-written solution, aiming to demonstrate not just correctness, but clarity, efficiency, and thought process.
